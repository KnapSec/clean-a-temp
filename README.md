# CLEAN-A-TEMP

### This batch file will help you clean the temp and prefetch directories. 

##### Recommended usage: Run as Administrator!

Syntax:
	
	clean-a-temp.bat
	

##### Personally I recommend adding it to **Task Scheduler** and set *Run with highest privileges*


I have also commented a few directories which were initially used for clearing Chrome and Firefox data, haven't checked them in a while now.
Would love to get feedback and suggestions to make this better and more effective.
